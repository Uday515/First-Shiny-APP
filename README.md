# First-Shiny-APP
Dashboard to analyse Physician's performance. 


So it's my first attempt trying shiny dashboard and R altogether. The code is laking commenting. However, I will do it ASAP.

Until then, enjoy running the dashboard. You can do so by running the following line on the console of Rstudio.
### runGitHub("First-Shiny-APP", "Uday515")
